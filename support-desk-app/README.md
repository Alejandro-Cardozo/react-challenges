# React Support Desk App üñ• &nbsp; ![easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

## How you will build it ‚ú®
- The app should show a list of support desk employees as well as their contact information.

- The information displayed should be the following: the name, the age, the gender, the email, the number, and the nationality of the employee.

- You can display up to eight employees on the screen.

- Below the employee's information, it should have a button that allows the user to send a direct message to the employee.

- When clicking the button, you can display a modal with a contact form or open your default email manager software. The decision is up to you.

- There is no need to add logic to the form, since you are going to use fake data from [this API](https://randomuser.me/) to get your users.
