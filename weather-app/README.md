# React Weather App üå• &nbsp; ![medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Medium-yellow)

## How you will build it ‚ú® <a name = "how_to_build_it"></a>
- The app should display the current weather (temperature + appropriate icon and label)

- You can add some extra details about the current weather, like humidity, dew point, apparent temperature, visibility, wind speed and direction, etc.

- The app should also display the forecast for the next 5 days.

- The user should be able to select between five different locations. Then the weather for that location should be displayed (as well as the forecast for the next five days).

- You should get the data from a trustworthy source like [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/api), [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/), [AccuWeather](https://developer.accuweather.com/) or [Micro Weather Service](https://m3o.com/weather/api).

- Use whatever tool you want to style the app.  :)
