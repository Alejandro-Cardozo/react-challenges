# React Audio Player App 🎧 &nbsp; ![medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Medium-yellow)

## How you will build it ✨
- The audio player should offer control features like playing or pausing a track, adjusting volume, moving to the next or previous track and moving a progress slider.

- Tracks can be stored within the project or consumed from an API

- If the user has gone through all of the track, you will figure out how to start at the beginning, to allow them to cycle through the tracks again.

- Finally, if you want to take your audio player to the next level,try adding a list with all the songs available for the album that the currently playing song belongs to
