# React Video App 🎥 &nbsp; ![easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

## How you will build it ✨
- On the app's main page, a list of YouTube videos should be displayed.

- Clicking any video should take the user to a page where the video can be played.

- There should be a comments section below the video where users can comment and see comments from other users.

- You can add a 404 page to handle urls with unknown IDs.

- Use whatever tool you want to style the app.  :)
