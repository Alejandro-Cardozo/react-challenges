# React ToDo App 📋 &nbsp; ![easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Easy-brightgreen)

## How you will build it ✨
- The app should list all the tasks (finished and unfinished) in a single row.

- The user should be able to mark any task as completed or unfinished by clicking over it.

- The user should be able to delete any task by clicking a delete button.

- At the bottom of the list, it should show how many tasks have already been completed.

- The user should be able to add new tasks using an input form placed below the task completed counter.

- Try styling the app with CSS styles written in JavaScript using a library such as Styled-Components, Emotion, or Glamorous.
